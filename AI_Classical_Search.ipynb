        "  The reason for complementing a sequence is because DNA has a double helical structure with two parallel yet complemented sequences. DNA has 4 nitrogen bases Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine and Thymine. A(Adenine) is always paired with T(Thymine) via a hydrogen double bond and C(Cytosine) is always paired with G(Guanine) via a hydrogen triple bond.\n",

        "  So when we compare the DNA from two different people we are taking one strand from each and compare.\n",

        "  Lets say sequence from person A is AGTCAGTC and sequence from person B is TCAGTCAG.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Now, when comparing both sequences we initially think they are different.\n",
        "  Let us complement DNA of person A.\n",
        "  The complemented sequence is TCAGTCAG which is the same as person B!"
